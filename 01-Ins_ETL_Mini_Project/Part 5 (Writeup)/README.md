# Project_2-Group_1
Data Science Project 2 SQL

In Project 2 we focused on ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load)
The data we use was a based off of crowdfunding campaigns of companies in multiple countries
We extracted the data from two excel files to create 4 csv files that we then transformend by dropping, splitting, renaming, cleaning, and grouping columns.
Using QDBD we created 4 data tables based off our CSVs and turned it into an ERD that showed the connections between the tables.
Then we loaded the schema that was generated into PgAdmin to create our SQL database query.
From there we analyzed by creating queries and data visualizations that represented our data.
